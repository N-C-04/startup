# Group Voting App

The Group Voting App is a simple, real‑time web application where users vote on a single question and instantly see the results update live. The interface is intentionally minimal, allowing users to cast a vote with one click and immediately view the current totals as they change.

### Elevator pitch

The Group Voting App is a simple, real‑time web application that lets users vote on a single question and instantly see the results update live. It removes all friction — no accounts, no complexity, just one click to vote and watch the totals change.

### Design

![Design image](image.png)

The user opens the app and is shown a single question with several voting options. When the user clicks an option, the vote is sent to the server, which updates the totals and broadcasts the new results to all connected users in real time. The updated results are immediately displayed on the screen.

### Key features

- One‑click voting on a single question with 3–4 options
- Real‑time results that update instantly for all users
- Simple and clean design

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will use HTML to define the basic structure of my pages, including the home screen, voting screen, and results screen before converting them into React components.
- **CSS** - I will use CSS to apply simple styling that centers content, formats buttons, and keeps the interface clean and readable.
- **React** - I will use React to break the UI into components, manage user interactions, and handle routing between the Home, Vote, and Results pages.
- **Service** - I will use a backend web service to provide endpoints for submitting votes, retrieving results, and fetching a fun fact.
- **DB/Login** - I will use a database to store persistent vote totals so the results remain accurate across sessions and server restarts.
- **WebSocket** - I will use WebSockets to broadcast updated vote totals to all connected clients in real time whenever a user casts a vote.
